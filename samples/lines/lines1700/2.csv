Such was the poise in which the battle hung
To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars.
And forests under the immortal feet                             25
The Trojans, tempest-like or like a flame,                      50
Olympian Jove himself his rage inspire.                         75
To cope with Priam's furious son, alone.                       100
Oh! I behold a prodigy, a sight                                125
Your tardiness will prove ere long the cause                   150
None stays its fury, till the level found,                     175
Advanced before him, trembling at a spear                      200
Hector with his resplendent spear assail'd;                    225
Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms                        250
Thoas! no Grecian is this day in fault!                        275
From bright Olympus shakes into the air,                       300
Both spears and bossy shields, with brazen casques             325
Even there, thy courage should no blame incur.[8]              350
Or on the left? for nowhere I account                          375
Meriones toward the left began,                                400
Not for complete destruction of the Greeks                     425
To chase, himself, however resolute                            450
Asius on foot before his steeds advanced,                      475
Eluded, cover'd whole by his round shield                      500
Of old Anchises, who to him had given                          525
Against me; learn the valor of a Chief                         550
But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear                          575
His fellow-warriors bold; them follow'd all                    600
Or shun another, or by swift retreat                           625
Then, casting his fraternal arms around                        650
Innumerable darts kept still secure.                           675
Helenus, with his heavy Thracian blade                         700
And trailing, as he went, the ashen beam;                      725
Above his nose; sounded the shatter'd bone,                    750
Soft dalliance, music, and the graceful dance,                 775
A son, whose death he never saw avenged.                       800
After dispersion of the shielded Greeks                        825
Of Ajax son of Telamon a step,                                 850
Had not Polydamas, at Hector's side                            875
All yesterday's arrear, since yonder Chief[15]                 900
But leftward of the woful field he found,                      925
Prompts thee, and thou shalt find us ardent all                950
Plated with brass; his helmet on his brows                     975
Earth-cumberer Ajax? Would I were the son                     1000
Quaff thou, while bright-hair'd Hecamede warms
Imperial Agamemnon, who had each
All, like Achilles, have deserted me
Inglorious, from their country far remote.
To speak discreetly, no man bearing rule
Because I am of greener years than ye,
We suffer worse; but we will others urge
But Juno of the golden throne stood forth
Breathed odors, and through all the distant earth.
Then thus with wiles veiling her deep design
With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts,
Bright, incorruptible; my limping son,
Both Gods and men, preserved me; for to her
Titanian call'd who in the lowest gulf
With neither steed nor chariot in thy train?
Nor sweet Acrisian Danäe, from whom
And there repose, since such thy pleasure seems.
Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft
Then, wounded as they were, themselves the Kings,
And Trojans shouting when the clash began.
And showering darts, to drag his body thence,
A Naiad, bore to Enops, while his herd
And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground.
A brother living to avenge his fall.
Boeotian Promachus must him bewail,
Of tremblers scatter'd by the frown of Jove.
Suspended thee, with anvils at thy feet,
Thy sacred life, and our connubial bed,
Afresh with courage, and all memory thence
Swift as the traveller's thought,[4] who, many a land
Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips
From Jove befallen, had not Minerva, touch'd
To rescue from the stroke of fate the race
My message, let him, next, consider well
Answer'd indignant. Great as is his power,
Thy speech, or wilt thou soften it? The wise
God thus to Apollo spake.
But seated; newly, as from death, awaked,
To flight the heroes of the host of Greece.
And when the sons of Greece held in dispute
While others all into the fleet retired.
A herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock
Entangled in the piles of the deep foss,
To ruin, and themselves drovest all to flight.
In rush'd the steeds, and at the ships they waged
The Trojan onset, firm, yet from the ships
Despoil him slain in battle at the ships.
Found him, and such as none could waft aside,
Leave then thy bow, and let thine arrows rest,
Therefore stand fast, and whosoever gall'd
Schedius, a Chief of the Phocensian powers
The bushy crest of Dolops' helmet drove
Or Ilium taken, from her topmost height
But Melanippus pierced heroic son
While, every Grecian heart he tamed, and took
And thickest throng, the warrior-ranks essay'd
All fled, but of them all alone he slew
Fast held them, and vociferating each
Unwieldy, twenty and two cubits long.
Than to consume the fleet with fire, and leave
Who me withheld from battle at the fleet
Press'd them, and whatsoever Trojan came,
With cause sufficient we should both deplore.                   20
But, if some prophecy alarm thy fears,                          45
The virgin chosen for me by the sons                            70
From his detested throat, but all around                        95
Ourselves escaping, might survive to spread                    120
Of Troy, the Thunderer had ordain'd to mar                     145
It was that Pelian ash which from the top                      170
Such seem'd the Myrmidon heroic Chiefs                         195
Ascending with her to an upper room,                           220
Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile                    245
His bark, and fill'd with tunics, mantles warm,                270
If my companion have a valiant heart                           295
So issued from their fleet the Myrmidons                       320
At the whole multitude his glittering spear.                   345
Turn'd on Patroclus, sudden with a lance                       370
Of Amisodarus; of him who fed                                  395
Blood also blowing through his open mouth                      420
Of Hector, him bore safe with all his arms                     445
Who drive forth justice, reckless of the Gods;                 470
On some projecting rock seated, with line                      495
Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash                 520
Of Menoetiades in conflict dire;                               545
That mischief soon Automedon redress'd.                        570
Thyself a Chief illustrious! thou hast need                    595
Had pierced him from it, in the fleet's defence.               620
Renown'd Agenor and the son he call'd                          645
Ardent for battle all, and at their head                       670
He, erst, in populous Budeum ruled,                            695
Then Glaucus first, Chief of the shielded bands                720
Till spent by slow degrees its fury slept.                     745
Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain's side             770
First then, with fears unmanly he possess'd                    795
(The dead man's portion) rearing to his name.                  820
Offspring of Megas, then Autonoüs,                             845
His host within the walls. Him musing long                     870
Leap'd ardent; in his left a spear he bore,                    895
And, victim of his own fierce courage, dies.                   920
Who fought to gain him. He, in eddies lost                     945
Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest                    970
His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,                         995
That I may turn from them that evil hour                      1020
To perish, by Æacides the brave.[21]                          1045
Her young one murmuring, with tender moan,
Of all the Danaï. But him, I ween,
Whom pacing backward in the throat he struck,
Then, easily had Menelaus borne
Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard
Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains
Into his chariot, and to others gave
From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left
Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!
The bearers of Achilles' arms to Troy.
Invigorated, and with loudest shouts
He ended; they compact with lifted spears
Of such contention; but oh, come yourselves
The body left, they fled; yet of them all,
His helmet brazen-cheek'd; the crested casque,
Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,
Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight
For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud
And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard
Protracted on that day the bloody toil
A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although
Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?
Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim
Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail'd
He shall himself the coursers ample-maned
Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear
Descending at the Thunderer's command
He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed
Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks
He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion's son
Nor Ajax, dauntless hero, not perceived,
Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such)
Departing, therefore, he admonish'd oft
To victory the Trojan host, and rolls
Expect I now, although with rage he burn
Faces them, scatter'd on all sides escape;
The level land, nor can they with the force
Of all my Myrmidons, while yet I live,
On the other side, Antilochus the hands
Luxuriant, Amathea; nor alone
They climb'd the beach, where by his numerous barks
For thy son's death, whom thou shalt never meet
Sweeter than dropping honey to the taste,
To save from threaten'd death our suffering friends.
Of Hellespont. Nor yet Achaia's sons
Stands at the fleet of Greece. Mutual prevails
I know not, save perhaps alone the shield
Issuing through the wall, beside the foss
Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight
By my advice, nor wait the sacred morn
With all their mass of solid timbers, smooth
The Grecians in their fleet hemm'd by the sea,
Whose counsel was discreet and wholesome none.
Me next, I will not thy funereal rites
And with a wide unsullied mantle, last.[7]
Twenty at once, his palace-wall to grace
And venerate is here, who when I fell
His visage, and his arms and brawny neck
I yet endured to share. He now, the prey
From ruin, sent, instead, Patroclus forth,
The managed winds, now forcible, as best
Such as men build. In one were to be seen
The other city by two glittering hosts
Who fed them. The besiegers, at that time
Crowded with corn, in which the reapers toil'd
Carolling to it with a slender voice.
For bright-hair'd Ariadne.[13] There the youths
The whole, he set it down at Thetis' feet.
The God, my mother! hath bestow'd in truth
To council all the heroes of the host.[4]
For long remembrance of our mutual strife.
Rests not with me; Jove, Destiny, and she
Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove!
That never to the starry skies again
By gifts to make me, or to make me none,
Fed with due nourishment, although he fight
Most truly. Let Achilles, though of pause
But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips
One day sufficient for our sighs and tears.
Full in the midst they placed them. Then arose
Then, in the centre of Achaia's sons
Restored to it again, here find thee dead.
Nor longer press me, mourner as I am,
Fight for detested Helen under Troy.
His friend, disconsolate; the other Greeks
His glorious arms, the labor of a God.
His coursers, then, Automedon prepared
But by the force of fate and power divine.
THE ILIAD.
Meantime, Jove order'd Themis, from the head                     5
Myself, here seated on Olympus' top,                            30
Mixed not with either host, Achaia's sons                       55
Of Erebus, and with a cry his fears                             80
Of Priam's son Lycaon, and his form                            105
Of battle, not with ease should he subdue                      130
Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt                         155
Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere                      180
Surpassing far, into the midst advanced                        205
His throne hereafter in Troy steed-renown'd?                   230
With words to scare me. I have also taunts                     255
The pasture sought, and cover'd them in form                   280
Consuming here, while battle roars around.                     305
Yield not so quickly to the force of man.                      330
Then had Æneas, as Achilles came                               355
Neptune! deliberate thyself, and choose                        380
Thus inconsiderately with the son                              405
Calling the Grecians after him.--Ye sons                       430
I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,                455
And Hermus, call'd the fertile soil his own.                   480
For show of nimbleness, he started oft                         505
That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.                  530
Thou venturest never where the javelin sings.                  555
His liver falling forth, with sable blood                      580
While, blown around, the flames roll to all sides,             605
That way they fled pouring themselves along
So lurk'd the trembling Trojans in the caves
And on the twelfth his fate cast him again
Ran under it, and to his knees adhered;
On Satnio's banks in lofty Pedasus.
My stature towers, and what a bulk I boast?
Fleeing, and slaughtering, I. This pleasant stream
Who art and whence, who dar'st encounter me?
And mid-length deep stood plunged the ashen beam.
Therefore, not kingly Acheloïus,
All Ilium's race to perish by thine arm,
The numerous bodies that his current chok'd
As when the peasant with his spade a rill
And a brave man had stripp'd me of my arms.
Right onward, by the flood in vain opposed,
Vortiginous, against Achilles hurl'd,
Dries the new-water'd garden,[7] gladdening him
By Vulcan raised. His supplication, then,
Well-pleased, and, in his heart laughing for joy,
With exultation, as he lay, exclaim'd.
And desolated) ceased long since in heaven.
By violence, and added threats beside.
That thou wouldst Neptune's self confront in arms.
Then, messenger of heaven, the Argicide
The other Gods, some angry, some elate
They, parch'd with drought and whiten'd all with dust,
All hope to scape a miserable death,
Terrible Chief and dauntless as thou art.

ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK.
Yet hope me not to slay; I cannot die.                          15
Of combat with Achilles, when his sire                          40
Commiserate also thy unhappy sire                               65
And lamentation; with one hand she bared,                       90
Reproaches on me, for he bade me lead                          115
Soever our fair city still includes?                           140
So flew Achilles constant to the track                         165
For some illustrious prize, a tripod bright                    190
That execute, and use thou no delay.                           215
A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand                           240
And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned                 265
Thrice I have compass'd Priam's spacious walls                 290
At once the agonies of every Greek                             315
Sought from Deiphobus, white-shielded Chief,                   340
Bright as, among the stars, the star of all                    365
By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth,                390
Requite thee on that day, when pierced thyself                 415
Who harm'd us more than all our foes beside,                   440
His head, so graceful once, now track'd the dust,              465
Fall'n by his hand, all whom I less deplore                    490
For noble Hector from the fight return'd.                      515
And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg'd                     540
Nor love of thine to share or kindness more.                   565
His father lost, must many a pang endure.                      590
Mourning they drove, while Thetis in their hearts
Amid fierce flames Vulcanian stretch'd to roast.
The dead, descending to the shades, to share,
Drive me afar, denying me my wish
Ah, loved and honor'd! wherefore hast thou come!
They, bearing each in hand his sharpen'd axe
First, moved the chariots, next, the infantry
Patroclus takes down with him to the shades.
Complete the body with it of his friend[8]
A veil of sable clouds from heaven to earth,
By all Achaia's warriors deep deplored.
Rolling the flood before them as they pass'd.
They quench'd it, and the hills of ashes sank.
Two golden talents, and, unsullied yet
Eumelus, King of men, Admetus' son
Equestrian, and hast little need to learn.
More likely, which the weather least impairs.
And to his place retiring, sat again.
Beat double; each encouraged loud his steeds;
Following, she gave to him his scourge again,
No favor shall ye find at Nestor's hands,
By some broad-shoulder'd youth for trial hurl'd
And hearing, though remote, the driver's voice
The hero Tydeus' son, brave Diomede,
From bitter speech offensive, and such terms
The hero Menelaus close pursued
The second prize; Tydides claims the first.
Whom much he loved; then, ardent, thus replied.
Yet hold--myself will judge, and will to all
As on the ears of growing corn the dews
Left unappropriated Achilles bore
Of Enops; wrestling, the Pleuronian Chief
The boxer's prize. He tether'd down a mule,
His bones to splinters, and let all his friends,
A huge fish flounces on the weedy beach,
By a prime artist proof against all winds.
Achilles, interfering, them restrain'd.
He said, and at his word instant arose
Have darted on the prize, then Ajax' foot
For the half-talent doubled shall be thine.
And thrice struck hand to hand. Ajax the shield
He swung, he cast it, and the Grecians laugh'd.
Received the lots; they shook them, and the lot
Then, last, Achilles in the circus placed
Their fellowship in toil; their hardships oft
Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still,
For whosoever hath a loss sustain'd
Wast present also with thine harp in hand,
By every nymph of Ocean round about
And thus the sire of Gods and men began.
She reach'd Achilles' tent. Him there she found
Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights.
And on his venerable head and neck
He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide
How canst thou wish to penetrate alone
And fear'd it but the more. But, since I saw
Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught
But scandals of my house, void of all truth,
The palace, and his herald, were employ'd

Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;
Wrought still within them; and no less desire
From Heavâns high jurisdiction, in new League
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,
This said, he sat; and expectation held
Threatens him, plungâd in that abortive gulf.
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose
Scowls ore the darkând lantskip Snow, or showre;
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
In confusâd march forlorn, thâ adventrous Bands
Of _Ternate_ and _Tidore_, whence Merchants bring
Lurâd with the smell of infant blood, to dance
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head
Then shining heavânly fair, a Goddess armâd
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
Fearless to be oârematcht by living might.
Unfastâns: on a sudden opân flie
Of _Barca_ or _Cyreneâs_ torrid soil,
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,
From your Dominion won, thâ Ethereal King
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell
Pavâd after him a broad and beatân way
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest
Blind _Thamyris_ and blind _Maeonides_,
His own works and their works at once to view:
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)
Through Heavân and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain
By me upheld, that he may know how frail
Against the high Supremacie of Heavân,
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarmâd.
My sole complacence! well thou knowâst how dear,
So easily destroyâd, and still destroyes
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes
Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
It seemâd, now seems a boundless Continent
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
_Cleombrotus_, and many more too long,
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passâd,
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The goodly prospect of some forein land
Allurâd his eye: Thither his course he bends
In _Aarons_ Brest-plate, and a stone besides
The same whom _John_ saw also in the Sun:
Thâ Arch-Angel _Uriel_, one of the seavân
Or open admiration him behold
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess
The rest in circuit walles this Universe.
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles
Warring in Heavân against Heavâns matchless King:
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?
The lower still I fall, onely Supream
Thrice changâd with pale, ire, envie and despair,
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,
Dwelt in _Telassar:_ in this pleasant soile
With mazie error under pendant shades
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
And should I at your harmless innocence
Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,
But let us ever praise him, and extoll
As I bent down to look, just opposite,
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,
In _Autumn_ thwarts the night, when vapors firâd
The vigilance here placât, but such as come
Silence was pleasâd: now glowâd the Firmament
That mock our scant manuring, and require
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,
That heavân would want spectators, God want praise;
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
And starrie Pole: Thou also madâst the Night,
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repairâd.  Sleep on,
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
_Gabriel_ from the Front thus calld aloud.
_Gabriel_, thou hadst in Heavân thâ esteem of wise,
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
Through wayes of danger by himself untriâd.
Patron of liberty, who more then thou
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
Which _Gabriel_ spying, thus bespake the Fiend.
When _Adam_ wakât, so customd, for his sleep
On _Adam_, whom imbracing, thus she spake.
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule
And let us to our fresh imployments rise
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronouncât or sung
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,
_Raphael_, the sociable Spirit, that deignâd
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies
_Alcinous_ reignâd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us
Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Can hearts, not free, be triâd whether they serve
The full relation, which must needs be strange,
Reignd where these Heavâns now rowl, where Earth now rests
Hear my Decree, which unrevokât shall stand.
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
Both waking we were one; how then can now
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
If these magnific Titles yet remain
Law and Edict on us, who without law
One over all with unsucceeded power.
And tempt not these; but hastân to appease
These tidings carrie to thâ anointed King;
His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
BOOK VI.
That of so many Myriads fallân, yet one
By Thousands and by Millions rangâd for fight;
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then
Such hast thou armâd, the Minstrelsie of Heavân,
On the proud Crest of _Satan_, that no sight,
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
The strife which thou callâst evil, but wee style
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retirâd
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.  On each wing
And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swervâd,
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field
Incapable of mortal injurie
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,
In motion or in alt: him soon they met
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row

They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence
To honour his Anointed Son avengâd
For thee I have ordainâd it, and thus farr
O Father, O Supream of heavânly Thrones,
And the third sacred Morn began to shine
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,
Not emulous, nor care who them excells;
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
At thy request, and that thou maist beware
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound
In Paradise to _Adam_ or his Race,
Absolvâd, if unforbid thou maist unfould
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purgâd
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.
And saw that it was good, and said, Let thâ Earth
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each
And sowd with Starrs the Heavân thick as a field:
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeerâd
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Floats, as they pass, fannâd with unnumberâd plumes:
Limbâd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
Femal for Race; then blessâd Mankinde, and said,

And anger wouldst resent the offerâd wrong,
In narrow circuit straitând by a Foe,
Or ought that might his happie State secure,

Till I in Man residing through the Race,
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call
Perpetual smilâd on Earth with vernant Flours,

All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes

Drink hearty draughts of ale from plain brown bowls,
VENTIDIUS, his General.
That they have lost their name.  Our fruitful Nile
Burst open, and disclosed the mighty dead.
Yet still war seems on either side to sleep.
SERAPION.  How stands the queen affected?
Who first showed Rome that Parthia could be conquered.
But, when his danger makes him find his faults,
With laurels crowned; with laurels wreath your posts,
ALEXAS.  Your emperor,
ALEXAS.  Would you could add, to those more shining virtues,
[Withdraws.]
[ANTONY having thrown himself down.]
My uncombed locks, matted like mistletoe,
VENTIDIUS.  Look, emperor, this is no common dew.
VENTIDIUS.  I warrant you.
Fled while his soldiers fought; fled first, Ventidius.
My careless days, and my luxurious nights,
ANTONY.  I do, to see officious love.
To fight, to conquer.
To double my despair?  They're mutinous.
ANTONY.  What was't they said?
VENTIDIUS.  I take the privilege of plain love to speak.
ANTONY.  Forgive me, soldier;
VENTIDIUS.  That's my royal master;
ANTONY.  Oh, thou hast fired me; my soul's up in arms,
Has taught my mind the fortune of a slave.
ALEXAS.  Think him inconstant, cruel, and ungrateful.
Just as he sent it, Charmion, undisguised,
Who shook and armed assembly with his nod;
And without power to give them?
More plainly?  To my ears, the message sounds--
ANTONY.  But just enough to season him from coward.
ANTONY.  Then give the word to march:
ALEXAS.  And yet she begs not now, you would not leave her;
And, that you may remember her petition,
To tell these pretty beads upon my arm,
ANTONY.  I will be justified in all I do
I left the acknowledgment for time to ripen.
As all your business were to count my passion!
And you have watched the news, and bring your eyes
And, half constrained, I gave, as to a tyrant,
Would I had been a man, not to have feared!
I know it well:  'tis that proscribing hand,
[Takes his hand.]
VENTIDIUS.  And what's this toy,
That I shall do some wild extravagance
ANTONY.  Thou join'st us well, my love!
ANTONY.  Now, on my soul, he loves me; truly loves me:
ANTONY.  Oh, think not on't, Ventidius!
ANTONY.  Thou hast what's left of me;
DOLABELLA.  Slaves to your fortune.
The gentle winds were lodged in purple sails:
And whisper in my ear--Oh, tell her not
What power was theirs, who wrought so hard a temper
But your Octavia, your much injured wife,
OCTAVIA.  Poorly and basely I could never beg:
Because 'tis mine; it never shall be said,
The greatness of your soul;
OCTAVIA.  Therefore, my lord,
ALEXAS.  The queen, my mistress, sir, and yours--
Must die, because she loves?
ALEXAS.  She is indeed a very miracle.
Your haughty carriage--
Is but to say the greatest of mankind
For one like that.
[Exit with her Train.]
DOLABELLA.  Nature has cast me in so soft a mould,
And yet the soul, shut up in her dark room,
CHARMION, IRAS on the other side.
And then this Dolabella, who so fit
CLEOPATRA.  I must attempt it;
To find your griefs so moderately borne.
Or sought you this employment?
What have I done!
To add to what he said; what dear farewells;
An hour's admittance to his private ear?
Let me begin, and you shall second me.
[Aloud.]
OCTAVIA.  You seemed disturbed, my Lord.
VENTIDIUS.  Young, I think him young,
Dolabella's Cleopatra; every man's Cleopatra.
I would abuse your ears with perjury?
I did, myself, o'erhear your queen make love
Her beauty's charms alone, without her crown,
ALEXAS.  Else had I never dared to offend his ears
OCTAVIA.  'Tis not well.
Too heavy to be borne; and you add more:
Let a feigned parting give her back your heart,
With as unfeigned a sorrow as you brought it?
DOLABELLA.  What's false, my lord?
Had no desires, no joys, no life, but you;
And yet thou didst not swear thou lov'st her not;
'Twas I blew up the fire that scorched his soul,
And cannot hurt the woman; but avoid me:
My joys, my only joys, are centred here:
DOLABELLA.  A perjured villain!
And shuffles, with a random hand, the lots,
If, from above, some charitable hand
If the first happen, fate acquits my promise;
The queen of nations, from her ancient seat,
'Twas then false Fortune, like a fawning strumpet,
Till you can clear your innocence.
And speak to Antony.
What can I say, to save myself from death?
With the first breath they draw.
To make a heap about us of dead foes,
VENTIDIUS.  See, see, that villain!
ALEXAS.  Too fatally she has:  she could not bear
And art thou dead?
[Exit.]
Were but my merchandise to buy her love;
I care not which I take:  I'm only troubled,
ANTONY.  Thou hast loved me,
We soon shall meet again.  Now, farewell, emperor!--
ANTONY.  Farewell!  Ever my leader, even in death!
Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMION, and IRAS
Esteemed before he loved; but hated now.
For your unkindness, and not one for love?
Shall knit our spousals with a tie, too strong
Enter CHARMION and IRAS
And win my share of the world.--Hail, you dear relics
Haste, bare my arm, and rouse the serpent's fury.
